# AppHackathon

X is a telemedicine platform designed to address healthcare access challenges in rural and
underserved communities. Leveraging mobile technology, X connects individuals in remote areas
with healthcare professionals remotely. The platform offers a range of features, including virtual
consultations, remote monitoring of vital signs, and access to medical advice through text or video chat.
X also facilitates the input of patient information in multiple languages for electronic health
records, ensuring accessibility for diverse populations. Additionally, the app enables patients to connect
with available hospitals, doctors, and emergency healthcare providers, bridging the gap between rural
communities and essential medical services.


To create X, a comprehensive telemedicine platform catering to rural and
underserved communities, several key features need to be included:

1. User Registration and Profile Creation: Allow users to create accounts with basic information
such as name, contact details, and location.

2. Text and Video Chat for Medical Advice: Offer real-time text and video chat functionalities for
patients to communicate with healthcare professionals for medical advice and guidance.

3. Hospital and Provider Directory: Include a searchable directory of hospitals, clinics, doctors, and
emergency healthcare providers, categorized by location and specialization.
4. Appointment Scheduling: Allow patients to schedule appointments with healthcare providers
based on availability.
